## Covid Pandemic Analysis

Hello Everyone, 

I made this Covid-19 Dashboard in Power BI with one of my own dataset Covid Cases and Death WorldWide.

## Problem Statement

To create an interactive COVID-19 Dashboard that provides meaningful insight about the pandemic's impact.

## Sections in the Report

**Report has multiple section's from where you can manage the data, like :**

- Report data can be sliced by country to show data of that particular country.

- Report has cards showing Population, Total Cases, Total Active Cases and Total Deaths.

- Report has a map section which shows the particular country selected from the slicer.

- And lastly, Report has a pie chart that shows Total Population of the Country and Total Population Recovered.
