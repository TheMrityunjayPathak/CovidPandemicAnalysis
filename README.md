😷 Covid-19 Corona Virus Pandemic 😷

Hello Everyone, 👋

I made this Covid-19 Pandemic Report in PowerBI with my own Dataset Covid Cases and Death World Wide.

📝 Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like:

1️⃣ Report Data can be sliced by Country to show Data of that particular Country.

2️⃣ It has cards showing Population, Total Cases, Total Active Cases and Total Deaths.

3️⃣ It has a Map Section which shows the Particular Country which is selected from the Slicer.

4️⃣ And Lastly, It has a Pie Chart showing Total Population of Country and Total Recovered Cases from that Country.
